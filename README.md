# ytdl

Download [Termux](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/) from F-Droid. Note that a rooted device is **not** necessary.


Optionally, download [Termux:API](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux.api/) to provide `termux-media-player`, and other command you may want to use.
    

**\[Important\]** Give Termux permissions to access storage, if access has not been previously granted:

`termux-setup-storage`

Run the script:

`curl -L --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://git.io/JEqID | bash -s -- REPLACEME`

`REPLACEME` must be changed to the name of another forked repo which is also under my github.
